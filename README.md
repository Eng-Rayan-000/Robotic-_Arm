##  Project Overview

This project demonstrates the design of a **5 Degrees of Freedom (DOF) robotic arm** created using **Tinkercad**, a browser-based 3D modeling and electronics simulation tool. The robotic arm is designed for basic automation tasks such as **picking and placing objects** in a simplified **warehouse** or **laboratory** environment.

##  Design Features

###  5 DOF (Degrees of Freedom):

1. **Base Rotation** – Allows the arm to rotate horizontally.
2. **Shoulder Joint** – Provides vertical lifting motion.
3. **Elbow Joint** – Enables the arm to extend or retract.
4. **Wrist Joint** – Allows wrist rotation and angular adjustments.
5. **Gripper** – Opens and closes to grab or release objects.

###  Tool Used:

* **Tinkercad** (for 3D modeling and circuit simulation)

---

##  Applications

*  **Educational tool** for learning robotics and mechanical design concepts
*  **Simulated testing** of object manipulation tasks in virtual environments
*  **Foundation** for building real robotic prototypes using servo motors and microcontrollers like **Arduino**
